# hsphere2cpanel
Utility script to pull hosting account data from an H-Sphere server and import it to CPanel/WHMCS

You will need to download the CPanel xmlapi.php file as it is included by the script, but not distributed with it.

Make sure you configure the settings, and also modify the switch/case statement with the proper hosting plan info from your H-Sphere.
